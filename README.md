<h1 align="center">Hi there, I'm Kyle Kingston! 👋</h1>

<p align="center">
  I currently work as a database administrator, but I have also been exploring Data Science.  I'm based in North Platte, Nebraska.
  <br />
  I'm passionate about expanding my understanding of data science and programming in general.  I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Computer Information Systems in 2013; however, since it was not a direct computer science degree, my experience with programming concepts was limited.  I've recently fallen back in love with programming and am trying to expand my knowledge. This led to a pursuit of a master's degree in data science.
